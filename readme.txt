This is a very simple plugin that adds support for a shortcode [wpcnl_show_table] to the site.
It displays a list of users which can be sorted based on their username and display_name options.
The list can further be filtered based on the role of the user.

Its very simple to use simply add [wpcnl_show_table] to any post, page or CPT. Alternately you can use the TinyMCE Editor
to insert this shortcode to the content pane. This shortcode will work only for admins / super admins on the site
